# Pirate Intelligent Agent - Deep Q-Learning Project

## Project Reflection

In this project, I implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm—specifically Deep Q-Learning—to solve a pathfinding problem for a pirate-themed intelligent agent. The goal of the agent was to navigate a maze and successfully reach a treasure while maximizing cumulative reward. I was provided with the foundational structure of the program, including class definitions for the maze and experience memory. However, I completed the core Q-training algorithm section myself, including the logic for exploration versus exploitation, storing agent experiences, training the model using neural networks, calculating loss, and determining optimal stopping conditions based on win rate performance. I also ensured that the code adhered to industry-standard best practices with in-line comments and consistent formatting to promote maintainability.

This project helped bridge the theoretical knowledge I acquired throughout the course with practical application in the broader field of computer science. Computer scientists design algorithms and systems to solve real-world problems, often automating decision-making processes in environments filled with uncertainty. This matters because technology is increasingly responsible for tasks that require complex reasoning—from autonomous driving and medical diagnostics to recommendation systems and robotics. Through this course and project, I learned to approach problems methodically, starting with clear requirements, identifying suitable algorithms, and iteratively testing and refining solutions. As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves a blend of logic, experimentation, and continuous learning.

Ethical responsibility is a critical aspect of developing intelligent systems. The models and algorithms we create impact real users and organizations. It’s essential to design with fairness, transparency, and accountability in mind. In the case of this project, even though it's a simulation, the implications of autonomous decision-making carry over to real-world applications. I must ensure that my solutions are reliable, respect user privacy, and are thoroughly tested to avoid unintended consequences. This mindset of responsibility and ethical awareness is something I carry forward into every technical project I undertake.
